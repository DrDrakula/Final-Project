## WeWatch

WeWatch is a chatroom application that lets users of the same chatroom watch online videos together. It was built using React, Ruby on Rails, CSS, ActionCable, and Redux.

## Motivation Behind the App

This app was made specifically to allow people, who live far away from each other, to watch YouTube videos together without having to time their pauses, un pauses and time skips, and also use the integrated chat option to write messages to everybody in the room.
